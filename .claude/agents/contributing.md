# Contributing Workflow

Keep this aligned with the canonical `CONTRIBUTING.md` and project governance.

## Project Tooling
- Dependency manager: Poetry.
- Pre-commit runner: prek (`poetry run prek run --all-files`).

## Expectations
- Follow existing patterns in `src/pynetlink`.
- Maintain test coverage; add tests for new behavior.
- Keep changes aligned with Home Assistant and automation use cases.

## Pull Request Notes
- Discuss changes via issue before large changes.
- PRs typically need two approvals before merge.
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the canonical workflow.
